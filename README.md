Shifter, a consulting and mentoring company, aims to provide valuable business knowledge through an innovative e-learning platform. To enhance the learning experience, I've developed a React Native app that enables users to easily access, purchase, and engage with various courses designed by the company.

With this app, consultants and mentors can upload and manage courses, making them readily available for users to explore. The app offers a seamless browsing experience where users can create personalized profiles, browse through a wide range of courses, and filter them based on their interests and needs. 
Once a course is selected, users can easily purchase it and enjoy on-demand access to course materials at their convenience.

The profile feature allows users to track their learning progress, manage course subscriptions, and stay up-to-date with new offerings. Additionally, the app supports an interactive learning experience, allowing users to listen to courses on the go, making learning more flexible and accessible.

The app is built using React Native for a smooth, cross-platform user experience and Firebase for a scalable, real-time backend that ensures secure course management and data storage.

This platform is designed to be intuitive, efficient, and effective, empowering users to access professional mentoring and consulting knowledge anytime, anywhere, while providing the company with an easy way to manage and expand its course offerings.
